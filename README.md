# JKoin üåç

## Overview
**JKoin** is a decentralized crowdfunding platform designed to support sustainability-focused projects. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures transparency and trust between donors and project organizers.

## How It Works
1. **Project Creation**: Organizations create projects and specify funding goals and deadlines.
2. **Donation**: Donors contribute to projects via smart contracts.
3. **Proof Submission**: Organizations submit evidence of project completion (e.g., images, documents).
4. **Review Period**: Donors review the proof and vote to release or deny funds.
5. **Fund Distribution**: Approved funds are released to the organization. If denied, donors can withdraw their contributions.
